# AutoJudge   
### Automated Programming Problem Difficulty Predictor

AutoJudge is a Machine Learning–based web application that predicts the **difficulty level** of programming problems (**Easy / Medium / Hard**) and assigns a **numerical difficulty score** based on the problem description.

---

##  Features
- Predicts problem difficulty: **Easy, Medium, Hard**
- Generates a difficulty score (1–10)
- NLP-based analysis using **TF-IDF**
- Clean and interactive **Streamlit** web interface
- End-to-end ML workflow (training → prediction → UI)

## 🔬 Model Experimentation

Multiple machine learning models were evaluated during development, including:

- Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
- Gradient Boosting
- Random Forest

Although SVC and Gradient Boosting models were tested with different hyperparameters, they did not outperform the Random Forest model on the given dataset.
Based on empirical evaluation and validation accuracy, **Random Forest** was selected for both classification and regression tasks, as it provided more stable and consistent results.




##  Project Structure
##  Important Note About Model Files

The file **`difficulty_regressor.pkl`** is **not included** in this repository.

🔹 Reason:  
GitHub does not allow uploading files larger than **25 MB**, and the regression model exceeds this limit.

🔹 The application has been **fully tested locally** with this model.
